## Guessing Game

The Project is a console-based application that simulates a simple Casino Guess Game. In this game, the player places a bet and tries to guess a randomly generated number. If the player guesses correctly, they win ten times their bet; if they guess incorrectly, they lose their wager. The game continues until the player either depletes their balance or chooses to stop playing.
